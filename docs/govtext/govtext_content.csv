summarisation,concept,"## CONCEPT
GovText offers two summarisation options:

1. **Normal**: using abstractive summarisation, the main points of a document are consolidated and paraphrased into a short paragraph which reads like a human written one  
2. **Quick**: using extractive summarisation, the most important sentences of a document are ""lifted"" and highlighted

Due to the complexity involved in performing an abstractive summarisation (normal summary), it takes up more computing resources and time. Therefore, users need to enter the maximum length (number of words) of the summary they want, and only one summary which is shorter or equal to this length will be returned.  

Extractive summarisation (quick summary) is very much faster than abstractive summarisation. When this option is activated, summaries of the following lengths will be returned for each document: 

1. Short (around 15% of original document length) 
2. Medium (around 30% of original document length)
3. Long (around 45% of original document length)

The abstractive summarisation uses models pre-trained on summaries of news articles. Therefore, abstractive summarisation works best on similar articles.

### Summarisation Options
As mentioned above, GovText offers two types of summarisation: 

1. By default (Quick Summary not checked), abstractive summarisation will be performed. This will return paraphrased summaries of the documents' main points but the time taken is longer. For this option, you will need to select the maximum summary length.

    Do note that the summaries returned might not be close to the selected maximum summary length (but they will definitely not be more than this length). This is because the model score the words in the summary and decide on the optimum length which provides the most coherent one. From our experiments, the model produces the most coherent summaries with lengths around 200 words.

2. If you select the Quick Summary option, key sentences from the documents will be highlighted using extractive summarisation. There is no need to select the maximum summary length for this option.

### Topic Modelling Configurations
There are two configurable options for Topic Modelling: **Infer Relationship between Topics** and **Number of Trials**.

Turning on the **Infer Relationship between Topics** option will activate the model which can infer correlations between topics. However, this will take a much longer processing time. Thus, for quick processing, this option is not recommended.

The **Number of Trials** option determines the number of models GovText will train to find more optimal models. The larger the number of trials, the more likely we can find more optimal models. However, it will also require a longer processing time. 

![Topic_Modelling_Submit4](/img/TopicModelling_Submit4.JPG)

Without the inferring relationship option, the number of trials can be an **integer between 3 and 100**. For a first try, we recommend a value between 10 to 20. 

With the inferring relationship option, the number of trials can be an **integer between 3 and 20**. For a first try, we recommend a value between 5 to 10.

#### _Top Words in Topic by Word Probability_ 
The diagram on the left displays the words in the selected topic, and its corresponding word probability value. This chart is downloadable as an image by clicking the download button at top right corner. 

**Word probability** is the probability of the word belonging to a topic. Each unique word in the dataset is assigned a set of probabilities of it belonging to each topic. For example, in a model with 4 topics,  a word is assigned a set of 4 probabilities. Each of the 4 values represents how likely the word belongs to each topic. Thus, it is possible for a word to appear in multiple word clouds. 

#### _Ranking of Documents by Topic Constitution_ 
On the right, you will see the full list of documents ranked by their **topic constitution scores** for the selected topic. 

Each document can be represented as a distribution of topics in which the document contains. 

For example, in a model with 3 topics, a document could be made up of 60% topic 1, 30% topic 2 and 10% topic 3  (adds up to 100%). In this case, when topic 1 is selected, the topic constitution score displayed will be 0.6. Thus, changing the topic selected will change the ranking of the documents in the dataset. 

You can reselect a topic by:

FAQ,1,"1. Which are the Topic Modelling algorithms used by GovText? Why did you use them? 


GovText provides two options for Topic Modelling using the following algorithms: 
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
* Correlated Topic Model (CTM)

We chose Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) because it is the most commonly used Topic Modelling technique across various domains. It is a statistical, unsupervised machine learning model for discovering abstract topics which occur in a collection of documents. However, its limitation is the inability to model topic correlation.

Therefore, we also added the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) algorithm so that users who want to see the correlation between topic models can do so. As compared to LDA, CTM uses a more flexible distribution for the topic proportions which allows for covariance structure. Even though it can give a more realistic model of the latent topic structure, it is much slower as compared to LDA.",155
FAQ,2,"3. Does GovText use Bag-of-Words or Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for the term weights?
GovText uses the Bag-of-Words technique for Topic Modelling, as per the original algorithm. 

In the introduction of this LDA paper, it states that TF-IDF provided “a relatively small amount of reduction in description length and reveals little in the way of inter- or intra- document statistical structure”. Hence, while TF-IDF can be used, it does not provide a significant advantage over the Bag-of-Words model. 
",155
FAQ,3,"5. How are the top 3 models selected? 
After the trial models have been trained, we select the best models based on the coherence score, which has been shown to have the strongest correlation with human ratings of topic models.

Instead of simply selecting the models with the maximum coherence scores, we used the formula ** abs|coherence score – 0.6|** to favour models which have coherence scores falling within the range of 0.4 to 0.8.

This is because a model with a coherence score lower than 0.4 is likely to have broad, general topics, while one with coherence score higher than 0.8 is likely to have topics which are too specific. It is difficult for users to interpret from the topic models what their dataset is about in both scenarios.
",155
FAQ,4,"1. Can GovText automatically extract only the content from emails for analysis? 
The current version of GovText does not do any specific preprocessing for emails. This means that, given an email or an email thread, the whole email, together with the headers, closing phrases and confidentiality clauses will be included for analysis.

While some of the default preprocessing steps may be helpful (removal of stopwords and dropping of tokens that look like email addresses), the automatic extraction of the content from the email is not currently supported.
",155
FAQ,5,"2. How does GovText handle spelling mistakes and SG specific terms / abbreviations (MOH, otw etc.)? 
GovText does not use a fixed vocabulary list. Therefore, words outside the English vocabulary (including Singlish words), and spelling mistakes are still treated as valid words for the Topic Models. In fact, if these words are important to a topic, they will appear in the topics and users will see them in the visualizations.
",155
FAQ,6,"Does GovText use lemmatization or stemming for word normalization?
GovText uses lemmatization for word normalization, instead of stemming.

The main reason behind this is to ensure that the (root) words making up the topics are valid English words, so that users can easily interpret them.

Lemmatization is part of the default preprocessing steps for topic modelling. 

Only English words will be lemmatized because GovText uses an English lemmatizer. Spelling mistakes will not be lemmatized. For example, the word “happiness” will be reduced to happy, but “hapy” will remain the same.
",155
FAQ,7,"4. What are the pre-processing steps performed by GovText under Topic Modelling?
The default pre-processing steps performed before topic modelling include the following:
* Sentence segmentation
* Part-of-speech (POS) tagging and tokenization
* Removal of stopwords
* Lemmatization
* Formation of n-grams",155
FAQ,8,"5. Are numbers dropped?
Numbers in both numerical (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and word (e.g. one, two, three, four, five) forms are dropped.
",155
FAQ,9,"6. How does GovText handle spaces and punctuations?
Spaces and punctuations are removed as part of the default preprocessing steps on GovText. 
",155
FAQ,10,"7. How did you create the default stopwords list? 
The default stopwords on GovText is built on Spacy’s stopword list, made up of words in the English language which usually does not add additional information to the sentence.

We expanded this list by adding Singlish stopwords like lah, leh, hor etc. The full list is shown to users in the stopwords page

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Stopwords_default.jpg')}/>",155
FAQ,11,"8. Does GovText include N-grams and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging? Will users be allowed to opt-out or customize these steps?
N-grams (bigrams and trigrams) and POS-tagging are part of the default preprocessing steps for Topic Modelling.

Users can see the n-grams in the output if they are important keywords in a topic. In addition, after POS-tagging is done, only adjectives, adverbs, nouns, proper nouns and verbs are used as input into the topic model.

Users do not have the option to exclude or alter these steps. ",155
FAQ,12,"1. What’s the abstractive summarisation model used by GovText?
GovText uses a Bidirectional and Auto Regressive Transformers (BART) model to do  abstractive summarisation. More information can be found at: https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/bart-denoising-sequence-to-sequence-pre-training-for-natural-language-generation-translation-and-comprehension/ 
",155
FAQ,13,"2. How does GovText overcome the maximum token count limit set by the transformers-based abstractive summarisation model?
For documents with lengths greater than the model limits, extractive summarisation is first done to reduce the lengths of the original documents by selecting only the most important sentences. Abstractive summarisation is then done on this extractive-summarised document. 
",155
FAQ,14,"3. What’s the maximum document length that could be summarised by GovText?
There isn’t an explicit word limit for summarisation and the team has tested GovText able to process documents up to 50k words. 
 
Please note that EXCEL file limits the total number of characters that a cell can contain to be 32,767 characters. However, if you know how to create a CSV file using a text editor, you can put in texts with much longer lengths (remember to save it in .csv format and upload it to GovText).
